1. What is the purpose?

    To give users the power to recreate their favorite photos.
    
    Once a keyword is entered in the search bar, a gallery of images is populated. With a simple click, users can view the location of the photo, along with the time of capture and camera type, as well as local weather and time for said location.

3. Challenges:

    Amelia: 
        Making everything web responsive, formatting a large amount of data in a user-friendly way.

        Learning to translate my thoughts into on-screen styles, especially  with Flexbox.


    Lorenzo: 
        The Maps API took some time to get acquainted with. Figuring out how to display the map and the data brought in from the Flickr API.

        Making the data from different APIs work together.

        Organizing my AJAX requests and function calls so they worked well together and were relatively easy to comprehend by looking at them.


4. How did you solve these problems/what did you learn?

    Amelia:
        I learned to use flexbox efficiently and how to use media queries for styling.
        Working to fit your own code with someone else's added a new dimension to the concept of coding.

    Lorenzo:
        I learned a lot about AJAX, particularly how data is returned from fetches, and how to manipulate objects.
        I learned to use parameters and local variables to my advantage in writing functions.

    Both:
        Learned how to use the git collaborative workflow by trial and error. 

        Learned how to plan out our tasks together, and check in with each other.

        Learned to discuss issues out loud and, whether or not one of us had an answer, found great benefit in hashing it out.

        Learned that consistent communication is key in any group work environment.
